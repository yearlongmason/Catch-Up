Welcome to **Catch-Up**, a project created by [John Groton](https://github.com/JohnnyG1234) and [Mason Lee](https://github.com/yearlongmason). Catch-Up is designed to help users stay connected with their friends, familiy, and team through keeping track of quotes.

## Our Mission

People love collecting quotes from friends, family, or favorite shows, but keeping them organized can be a challenge. Traditional quote books often become chaotic and hard to navigate over time.

This project offers a fun and convinient way to store and organize quotes. It combines a secure database and a user-friendly website where you can:

- View and manage your quotes.
- Explore fun statistics about them.

## The Tech Behind It:

The project integrates with Discord, a popular chat platform, and includes a custom bot. This bot:

- Lets users submit quotes easily.
- Lets users access quotes in unique ways.
- And much more!
